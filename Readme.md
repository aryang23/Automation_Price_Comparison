* I have created this proect using Automation and Puppeteer and JavaScript.

* This price is basically for comparing the prices between various sites like **Amazon, Flipkart, Paytm**

* Just search for the Product that you want to buy and It will automatically go to all the sites and print the data of the first 5 entries in a table where you can easily compare and find the best product for you.

* Like, I want to buy iPhone 11, And I simply searched for that and In return got these results where I can easily compare.

Note: - This is a kind of Practice Project, not for any hacakthon or official thing.
